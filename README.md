# 495-VDebate

## 1.0) About

495-Vdebate is the infrastructure of the website that was decided to be created for the promotion of a local debate championship. This infrastructure was built and is being developed with the latest version of Vue.js.

This template is highly personalized, but is available to the community. The status of the site is not very good, but debugging and cleanup is still in progress!

It will be re-released as a community template in the future.

## 1.1) Using this template.

495-Vdebate template can be forked and/or downloaded through this repository!

Both 'stable' and 'release' versions are available for download:

- most people should choose the 'stable' version, as this has been more extensively tested, and has less css conflicts.
- the 'nightly' version includes the latest features, but IS less reliable, and visually buggy.


## 1.2) Template documentation

Documentation is still a work in progress. Since this template is still too personalized, I will prepare a very understandable documentation once it is finished being styled for a more general use.


## 1.3) Supported browsers

This template works on the newer versions of both Chromium and Gecko based browsers. But for users who prefer to keep JS turned off; because of the excessive JS content, the site will probably be broken


### 1.3.1) Legacy support

Stop using IE already.
